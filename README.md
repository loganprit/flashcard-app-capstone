The application offers a clean, intuitive interface making your study routine as smooth as possible.

## Technology Stack
- **JavaScript**: For crafting the core application logic and ensuring dynamic user interactions.
- **React**: To build a responsive, component-driven user interface, making state management across multiple components seamless.
- **Express**: For setting up a robust server capable of handling API requests efficiently.
- **Knex**: For query building and database interactions, ensuring data integrity and ease of access.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application, creating an engaging and accessible user experience.

## Features
- **Deck Management**: Users can create new decks, edit existing ones, and delete those no longer needed, all through an easy-to-use interface.
- **Flashcard Creation**: Add new cards to your decks with custom questions and answers, edit them on the fly, or remove them as you progress.
- **REST API**: A full suite of RESTful endpoints allows for full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality over your decks and cards.

## Usage
To get started:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Use `npm start` to launch the application on your local server.
4. Visit the indicated local address in your web browser to start using the app.
5. Begin by creating a new deck and adding cards to start your studying journey.

## Discoveries
This project was a profound journey through full-stack development. I learned the importance of component structure in React, the efficiency of Express as a server framework, and the power of a well-organized REST API to handle complex data operations.

## Future Goals
Future updates aim to introduce user authentication for personalized study sessions and a mobile-responsive design for studying on the go.
